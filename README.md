# ✨ Spark – An Accountability App

A work-in-progress productivity app built to gamify goals, boost focus, and track habits that actually stick.  

Spark is my sandbox for full-stack dev. Inspired by my love of behavior change, game mechanics, and beautiful UX.

> Currently in **Phase 2**: Building timers + manual time tracking ⏱



## 🧭 Project Roadmap (7 Phases)

This project follows a structured, 7-phase roadmap to grow from a simple goal tracker into a feature-rich, AI-enhanced productivity platform. Each phase introduces new engineering concepts and challenges.

| Phase | Focus                              | Status     |
|-------|-------------------------------------|------------|
| ✅ 1   | Core goal tracking (CRUD)          | Complete   |
| 🔨 2   | Pomodoro + time logging            | In Progress |
| ⏳ 3   | Habit tracker + streaks            | Planned    |
| ⛩️ 4   | Auth + user accounts               | Planned    |
| 📊 5   | Dashboards + visual insights       | Planned    |
| 🧪 6   | Testing + validation               | Planned    |
| ✨ 7   | AI, onboarding, delightful UX      | Planned    |


## 🔧 Stack & Tools

| Frontend       | Backend       | Data & Auth      | Dev Tools       |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| React (Vite)   | FastAPI       | Supabase (Planned) | Prettier + ESLint |
| TypeScript     | Pydantic      | JWT (Planned)    | Git + GitHub     |
| TailwindCSS    | SQLAlchemy    | SQLite/Postgres  | Vitest (Planned) |



## 🧠 Why I'm Building This

Spark is a personal playground where I'm:
- Practicing frontend patterns with real UX
- Strengthening my backend/API design skills
- Building toward a polished tool to use alongside my Braid project
- Exploring gamification and behavioral nudges through code


## 🛠 Features by Phase

### ✅ Phase 1 – Core Accountability
Basic goal tracking with weekly resets, categories, and notes  


### 🔨 Phase 2 – Time & Focus Layer (WIP)
Pomodoro timer + manual time logging
